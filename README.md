Public API mocking for Python.

Unmock can be used to test modules that perform requests to third-party
APIs like Hubspot, SendGrid, Behance, and hundreds of other public APIs.

Unmock can also be used to mock these APIs in a development environment,
i.e. an express server on a local machine or in a staging environment.

The Unmock Python package offers a minimal, "do-it-yourself" SDK to mock responses with minimal intrusion to your codebase.

The ultimate goal of unmock is to provide a semantically and
functionally adequate mock of the internet.

Unmock also provides access via other languages. Our most advanced and up-to-date package is [unmock-js](https://github.com/unmock/unmock-js) - check it out to see what's coming soon to Python!
Unmock for .Net, PHP and Java is in the works. We're open to more requests - just [let us know](mailto:contact@unmock.io)!

## How does it work?

Unmock works by overriding Python's low-level `HTTPConnection`'s and
`HTTPRequest`'s functions, thereby capturing calls
made by popular packages such as `requests` and `urllib3`.

## Install

```sh
$ pip install unmock
```

## Usage

### Capturing outgoing requests

There are many ways to import unmock and start using it. You may choose from the following methods, as per fits your needs:

```python
""" 1: verbose: """
# test_foo.py
import unmock
# ...
unmock.on()
# do stuff with outgoing requests
unmock.off()

""" 2: context manager """
# test_foo.py
import unmock
with unmock.patch():
  # do stuff with outgoing requests

""" 3: with as a pytest plugin: """
# test_foo.py
# run with `pytest --unmock`
def test_my_awesome_function(unmock):
  # do stuff with outgoing requests
```

### Ingesting responses

The above snippets will capture all outgoing requests, and return an empty body response with status code 200 (`OK`) for all requests.  
Of course - that's not what we set out to do. Behind the scenes, unmock aggregates the outgoing information until the request is ready to be sent, and it then sends out a `Request` object with the following interface:

```python
Request.host:     str  # The hostname, e.g. `www.example.com`
Request.endpoint: str  # The endpoint requested, may include a query string, e.g. `/`, or `/foo/?bar=baz`
Request.method:   str  # The HTTP method requested, e.g. `GET`
Request.port:     int  # The port used in the request. This effectively represents HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), or custom port
Request.headers:  Dict[str, str]  # A mapping of headers and their values
Request.data:     Union[None, Any]  # The body of the request, if any
Request.qs:       Dict[str, List[str]]  # A mapping of query string and the values associated with them
```

### Specifying responses

The `Request` class allows you to filter requests and reply with different responses, based on the request data. A typical response is a **dictionary** consisting of up to 3 items:

- `"content"`: a string or a dictionary (JSON-parsable) for the content of the response. Defaults to the empty string if not specified.
- `"status"`: an integer specifying the HTTP status code response. Defaults to 200 (`OK`) if not specified.
- `"headers"`: a mapping between a header and its value. Defaults to an empty dictionary if not specified.

### Tying it together (and other keyword arguments)

`unmock.on()`, `unmock.patch()` and the `unmock` fixture in pytest can be called with two keyword arguments. The first and most important one is `replyFn`. It accepts a function which will be used to generate responses. The `replyFn` will be called every time a request is made, and will be passed the single `Request` class as defined above. The returned value is expected to be a dictionary matching the response dictionary.  
Additionally, one may specify a list of whitelisted hosts/endpoints, for which the request will be allowed to pass through, using the `whitelist` keyword argument. An asterisk is used as a wildcard if you wish to capture an entire hostname (e.g. `*.google.com/*` will capture any and all requests made to Google).

### Examples

The following example snippet uses the `unmock` fixture (with pytest). The `replyFn` returns either a 200 response for requests to `zodiac.com` or 404 for any other website. For zodiac-requests, it returns a mock for requests to the scorpio horoscope, otherwise it returns an empty response.

```python
# horoscope.py
import requests
def get_horoscope(sign):
  return requests.get("https://zodiac.com/horoscope/{}".format(sign))

# test_horoscope.py
from horoscope import get_horoscope

def replyFn(req):
  if "zodiac.com" in req.host:
    sign = req.endpoint.split("/")[-1]
    if sign.lower() == "scorpio":
      return {"content": {"horoscope": "You will be lucky! Someday..."}, "status": 200 }
    return {"status": 200}
  return {"status": 404}

def test_horoscope(unmock):
  unmock(replyFn=replyFn)
  res = get_horoscope("scorpio")
  assert res.status_code == 200
  assert res.json().get("horoscope") == "You will be lucky! Someday..."
```
