Public API mocking for Python.

Unmock can be used to test modules that perform requests to third-party
APIs like Hubspot, SendGrid, Behance, and hundreds of other public APIs.

Unmock can also be used to mock these APIs in a development environment,
i.e. an express server on a local machine or in a staging environment.

The Unmock Python package offers intuitive, hassle-free SDK to the
Unmock service with minimal setup steps.

The ultimate goal of unmock is to provide a semantically and
functionally adequate mock of the internet.

Unmock also provides access via other languages, all with similar
interface. We have [unmock-js](https://github.com/unmock/unmock-js)
already publicly available, and we are working on .Net, PHP and Java.
We're open to more requests - just [let us know](mailto:contact@unmock.io)!

## How does it work?

Unmock works by overriding Python's low-level `HTTPConnection`'s and
`HTTPRequest`'s functions, thereby capturing calls
made by popular packages such as `requests` and `urllib3`.

## Install

```sh
$ pip install unmock
```

## Usage

### Quick Start

```python
import unmock
import requests

# Determine the reply callback
def replyFn(request):
  # `request` is a dictionary with keys like `host`, `qs`, etc.
  if request.host == "www.example.com":
    name = request.qs.get("name", ["World"])
    s = "Hello {}!".format(name[0])
    # return value should be a dictionary with keys `content` (body), `status`, and `headers`
    return {"content": s, "status": 200, "headers": {"Content-Length": len(s)}}
  return {"status": 400}

# Activate unmock to start intercepting requests
unmock.on(replyFn=replyFn)
res = requests.get("https://www.example.com/?name=foo")
assert res.text == "Hello foo!"
assert res.headers.get("Content-Length") == str(len("Hello foo!"))
# Disable interception
unmock.off()
```

### Tests

<!-- Write about:
  1. using unmock.on() and possible keywords (replyFn and whitelist)
  1a. unmock.off()
  2. Using with unmock(...)
  3. pytest flag
  4. pytest fixtures
